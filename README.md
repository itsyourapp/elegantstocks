# Elegant Stocks

Elegant Stocks is a simulation of market trading that combines an easy and intuitive modern interface for market information with a fun and gamified stock trading experience. The experience focuses on investment education, beginning with stocks and progressing through options, index fund investing, investment and tax strategy. While the user is immersed in learning, they'll absorb real market data (and marketNews). If users find Elegant Stocks a fun, educational and informational experience they will likely continue to use it for market updates, information and marketNews. Elegant Stocks can be designed in a way  that when it matures enough for incubation, any free/fake services can be replaced with proprietary or robust platforms, becoming a legitimate long term investing advisory application.
